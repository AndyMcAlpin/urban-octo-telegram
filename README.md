# Horiseon Code Refactor

A Refactoring of the code on Horiseon's home page in order to make
it follow accesibility standards and to offer search engine optimization.

I went through and changed all the divs to use semantic html.  Then I fixed the link to the search engine optimization section that was broken.
I consolidated the css by combining separate classes with the same styling into single more global classes.  
I added descriptions to the images and notes on the css so everything was apparent.
